**Gift Delivery App API**
-----------

This API is modeled after an app for which I developed. It's a cross between 1-800-Flowers and DoorDash in that users may order gifts to loved ones in a fast and efficient way.

I added a column for a personal message to add a personal touch for each order.

This API allows the developer to examine orders made by the app user and make changes to them.

**Endpoints:**
----------
**GET**   api/gift (shows a list of all orders placed)

**DELETE**  api/gift/{id} (allows developer to delete an order)

**PUT**   api/gift/{id} (allows developer to change an order)
